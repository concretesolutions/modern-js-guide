#### Ways of creating content:
 * Create content from scratch: Free mode...
 * Extract or reference content from an existing source: Take for ex. this [thread](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/javascript/186/functions/843/immediately-invoked-function-expressions#t=201703091741223822698), you can just paste the link, but may be you'd like to add some content of your own or suggest another link, so you can extract just the subjects of the article and paste the correspondent link.
 
 Ex:
 
 **Function Scoping** (extracted title of the subject)
